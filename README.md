<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

>[!WARNING]
> **This package manager is in development, it is not done yet and may not be complete for a while, you can check out the [Development](#Development) and [Contributing](#Contributing) sections for details on how to help or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/awfixer) to talk about what we are doing**

#### This product has a bit of a missleading name, being a package manager means one of two things, it means what you think, and it means what it is. Let's break that down so that we can figure out what the purpose of AWFixerPM is.

> _What is a package manager?_ 

A package manager is kinda a literal thing, to be honest with you. It manages packages. Issue is that your traditional package manager is kinda racist. It will only manage a specific kind of package, one that is predeterined to be the superiour kind of package. Debian's apt will only manage .deb packages. Fedora's DNF will only manage .rpm packages. And so on. That is also true for pipx cargo pnpm, and so on. This is where AWFixerPM will be different. It will be a system wide package manager, with the power to utilize other packaging formats as needed to keep your system up and running.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

AWFixerPM will be kind of like a PM for your PM, but with super powers. Because of what we established about package managers [above](#about-the-proect) We know that there s a base function to a package manager, and all of the rest is just glit and glam. We also know that when it comes to packages there are three forms, Distro, bianary, and language. This package manager serves to be a point that connects all three, and maybe add a flavor of our own. Using the Nix language we are able to accomplish this.



_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://docs.awfixer.dev)_
